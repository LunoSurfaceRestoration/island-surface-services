    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <div class="services">
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Power Washing</h3>
        <p>Our power washing service removes built-up dirt, moss, oil, and surface stains to instantly refresh the look of your driveways, walkways, and exterior concrete. Using high-pressure equipment and attention to detail, we clean thoroughly without damaging your surfaces. It’s an effective way to boost curb appeal, improve safety by reducing slippery buildup, and prepare areas for sealing or other treatments. Perfect for homeowners looking to maintain a clean, well-kept property.</p>

      <div class="service">
        <h3>Concrete Sealing</h3>
        <p>Concrete sealing adds a protective barrier that helps prevent cracking, staining, and moisture absorption—perfect for residential driveways, walkways, and patios. The sealant enhances durability while providing a clean, subtle sheen that improves the overall look of the surface. By sealing your concrete, you extend its lifespan and make ongoing maintenance easier, helping it stay strong and attractive through changing weather conditions.</p>

      <div class="service">
        <h3>Asphalt Sealcoating</h3>
        <p>Protect and refresh your driveway with our hand-applied asphalt sealcoating service, designed for precision and long-lasting results. As a small, detail-focused business, we take the time to apply every coat carefully by hand—ensuring full coverage and a smooth, clean finish. Ideal for residential driveways and paths, sealcoating helps guard against cracks, UV damage, and water penetration, while restoring the rich, black look of freshly laid asphalt.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Crack Sealing</h3>
        <p>Crack sealing helps prevent minor cracks in asphalt or concrete from spreading and causing deeper damage. By filling and sealing these cracks, we stop water infiltration, reduce erosion, and extend the life of your surface. It’s a simple, effective solution for maintaining residential driveways and walkways, and it serves as an important first step before sealcoating or other surface treatments.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Garage Epoxies</h3>
        <p>Transform your garage with a high-performance, glossy epoxy floor that stands up to stains, chemicals, and everyday wear. Epoxy creates a smooth, seamless surface that’s easy to clean and visually elevates your space. It also adds a protective barrier against moisture and cracking, making it a smart choice for homeowners who want a polished, professional look while extending the life of their concrete.</p>
